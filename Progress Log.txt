Apr 22:
Begin pseudocode, look at getting Baxter Dataset

Apr 23:
Completed high level pseudocode.
Completed basic data storage spec for cost volume. 
Pseudocode continues. 
Spent time looking at example rendering code, postponing usage until later.
(Maintenance) Install PTAM, Newest OpenCV, ROS Hydro on new workstation.

Apr 24:
Level 2 pseudocode (nearly runnable, full idealized interfaces) begins
Discovered two major issues: 
1. PTAM is not compatibly licenced with OpenCV
2. DTAM wants threads to run properly, but OpenCV does not allow 
    internal threading. 
Spent most of day trying to figure out how to resolve these issues.

Apr 25:
Devised new design for program to stay within guidelines
DTAM will consist of a Mapper and Tracker. These will run as seprate threads
from the rest of the program. The threads are thin wrappers around 
the Map and Track classes, which are the internal machinery of DTAM, but without
any internal driving threads. These classes are the ones that will be in OpenCV
and it will be the user's responsibility to ensure that they are powered by 
seperate threads, or by a single thread so fast it avoids dropping frames.

Week 2
Apr 28:
Nearly completed level 2 pseudocode on map side. Just need the projection step and a way 
to automatically detect new keyframes. So overall we're ~ 1 day behind schedule,
which is okqy because of flexibility built in, but still a bit unnerving.
